# Sequences

this file holds a .fasta file of rbcL gene sequences from five seaweed species that wre used in the protocol to design primers and construct a phylogenetic tree

the data and protocol ware presented in the [2024-06-27-protocol_design_primers_and_perform_phylogenetic_tree](../../post/2024-06-27-protocol_design_primers_and_perform_phylogenetic_tree.md) post

additionally the resulted primers and phylogenetic tree are in the [Alinment_and_primers](../../resolts/Alinment_and_primers) folder
