# How das Temperature Changes affect Seaweed Growth

## Introduction
The effects of climate change will continue to significantly impact marine ecosystems. Seaweeds, as primary producers and foundation species in coastal ecosystems, are particularly vulnerable to these changes alter the biochemical composition affecting their nutritional value and chemical defenses. Are goal is to investigate the individual and combined effects of climate change on F.vesiculosus (a model species of seaweed) using a fully crossed experimental design with difrent research methods and data analysis technics we will simulating future climate conditions (-4 psu, +5°C, +700 µatm) will assess growth, biochemical composition, and susceptibility to grazing by Littorina obtusata.

## Methodology
**Integrating Methods into Research on *Fucus vesiculosus***

### 1. qPCR (Quantitative PCR)
- **Objective**: Quantify gene expression changes in *Fucus vesiculosus* under different climate conditions.
- **Application**: Identify and measure the expression levels of genes related to stress response, biochemical composition, and growth. This will provide insights into how the seaweed’s molecular pathways are affected by simulated climate changes.

### 2. Genetic Tree Analysis
- **Objective**: Understand the genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships within *Fucus vesiculosus* and possibly related species.
- **Application**: Use genetic sequences to construct phylogenetic trees. This helps assess whether different climate conditions lead to significant genetic divergence or adaptation in your model species and if observed effects are consistent across related species.

### 3. GNPS Molecular Networking
- **Objective**: Analyze changes in the chemical composition of *Fucus vesiculosus*.
- **Application**: Utilize GNPS (Global Natural Products Social) to create molecular networks and identify shifts in metabolite profiles under different climate scenarios. This will help understand how climate change affects the production of secondary metabolites and chemical defenses.

### 4. R Coding
- **Objective**: Analyze and visualize data from the experiments.
- **Application**: Use R for statistical analysis and visualization of growth, biochemical composition, and grazing susceptibility data. R can handle various types of data (e.g., qPCR results, GNPS outputs) and perform tasks such as regression analysis, clustering, and graphical representation.

### 5. Fluorometry
- **Objective**: Measure specific biochemical components and their concentrations in *Fucus vesiculosus*.
- **Application**: Use fluorometric assays to quantify levels of pigments, proteins, or other key compounds. This provides additional insights into how climate change affects the biochemical composition and nutritional value of the seaweed.

By combining these methods, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of how climate change impacts *Fucus vesiculosus* at multiple levels - from gene expression to biochemical composition to overall growth.
